# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in improving this project! A few guidelines:

- Keep changes focused and small. One feature / fix per PR.
- Run existing tests (if present) before opening a PR.
- Use the project's code style and keep UI changes to `static/style.css` when possible.
- For database schema changes, include a migration plan or instructions to reset the SQLite DB.

Please open issues for suggestions or bugs and submit PRs for fixes.
